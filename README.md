# Aselsan-Stock-Price-Prediction

In this prediction model, our aim is to predict the future price of stocks of Aselsan.

# Details and Expected Problems

The code was not worked in Pycharm and Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Pycharm Error Tips:

1. I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 FMA

2. To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.


3. Some errors are like; ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement LSTM
You wil face this kind of problem. To solve it, please try to install packages on terminal or cmd.

4. ValueError: Failed to find data adapter that can handle input: (<class 'list'> containing values of types {"<class 'numpy.ndarray'>"}), (<class 'list'> containing values of types {"<class 'numpy.float64'>"})

To figure out this problem, you need to consider array types. we need numpy array not array.
This link was be helpful as well for array problem.

# Google Colab
Becuase of this problem, Google Colab was used.
Google Colab is actually Jupyter notebooks that run in the cloud and are highly integrated with Google Drive.

Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser.

ipynb is a notebook extension and it can be used by Google Colab
